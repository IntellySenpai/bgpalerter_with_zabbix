# bgpalerter_with_zabbix

This is a short guide how to integrate BGPalerter software with Zabbix.
I will add the scripts I created to make bgpalerter autonomous ( write logs, heals when fails, report to Zabbix failures and reports, updates itself... )
The scripts are written in Bash, and the comments inside them will help you modify them at your need.
